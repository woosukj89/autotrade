# Progress Log

## Iteration 1 (baseline: drawdown + VIX-level + VIX-spike fast_panic OR'd)

| Metric | Result | Target | Pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage | 70.7% | ≥85% | FAIL |
| False-positive rate | 12.9% | <5% | FAIL |
| Defensive return | 61.6% | >5% | PASS |

66 entries. Diagnosed: 43 of 46 pure-false-positive episodes were `fast_panic`
firing on short (4-12 day) VIX blips unrelated to real bears.

## Iteration 2 (fast_panic = drawdown-only, VIX removed entirely)

| Metric | Result | Target | Pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage | 68.4% | ≥85% | FAIL |
| False-positive rate | 7.4% | <5% | FAIL |
| Defensive return | 2.5% | >5% | FAIL |

**Why VIX was removed, not just re-thresholded**: checked VIX level during
the 3 real bears vs. the false-positive episodes directly. 2022's own
bear-period max VIX was 36.5 — *lower* than several false alarms (2011 debt
ceiling: 48.0; an Aug-2024 flash spike: 38.6). VIX level doesn't reliably
separate "real bear" from "acute-but-contained panic" for this ground
truth — raising the threshold would have cost 2022 coverage without fully
fixing the false-positive problem. Entries dropped 66 → 20, false-positive
rate roughly halved, but coverage and (surprisingly) defensive-return both
got worse.

Diagnosed the defensive-return drop and the coverage shortfall to the same
root cause, visible in the per-episode list: 2022 coverage was fragmented
across 4 separate episodes with gaps during **bear-market rallies**
(Mar-Apr 2022 and Jul-Aug 2022 both saw sharp multi-week counter-trend
bounces that satisfied the exit condition, forcing a whipsaw exit and
re-entry). Every whipsaw both loses coverage (gap while re-triggering) and
costs the defensive-return metric (a short position gives back gains during
the bounce it exited into aggressive for).

## Iteration 3 (+ minimum 20-day dwell time before exit is considered)

| Metric | Result | Target | Pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage | 71.5% | ≥85% | FAIL |
| False-positive rate | 8.6% | <5% | FAIL |
| Defensive return | 4.6% | >5% | FAIL (close) |

17 entries. 2022 coverage 56.1% → 61.2%, 2022 defensive return 1.5% → 9.4%.
Confirms the whipsaw diagnosis was right. False-positive rate regressed
slightly (7.4% → 8.6%) since the dwell requirement also extends genuine
false-positive episodes once they trigger — expected trade-off, not a new
problem.

## Remaining known issues (next steps, not yet attempted)

1. **2011 debt-ceiling crisis (Aug-Oct 2011, 77 days) is the single largest
   remaining false-positive episode.** It's a real, sharp, well-known market
   stress event (~19% SPX decline, US credit downgrade) that misses this
   repo's ground truth only because (a) it's just under the 20% bear
   threshold and (b) SPY's dividend-adjusted closes cushion it below even
   the 10% correction threshold. Not a clear signal bug — a genuine edge
   case in how ground truth is measured (SPY total-return vs. SPX
   price-only). Worth a documented judgment call, not silent exclusion.
2. **2022 coverage (61.2%) is still the weakest of the three bears.** The
   `trend_sustained` / `trend+credit_confirmed` entry paths (10-day
   confirmation) are inherently slower than `fast_panic`'s single-day
   trigger — appropriate for a slow grind, but worth testing whether
   `trend_confirm_days` can come down without re-opening the false-positive
   problem iteration 1 had.
3. **Defensive-return (4.6%) is closest to passing but still short.** Worth
   testing a steeper/more responsive defensive-sleeve instrument mix (this
   analysis uses realized SH returns already — see
   `backtest_classifier.py:defensive_sleeve_returns`) rather than further
   signal tuning; the classifier's timing is arguably already close to
   adequate for this metric specifically.
4. Have not yet tuned `drawdown_threshold`, `drawdown_lookback`,
   `credit_z_threshold`, or `sma_window`/`entry_buffer_pct` individually via
   a real parameter sweep — all 3 iterations above changed the *architecture*
   (which signals feed the entry/exit logic), not yet the specific numeric
   thresholds within the current architecture. A systematic sweep is the
   natural next step before concluding the architecture itself needs to
   change further.
5. Have not yet built the portfolio-level `Strategy`/`Backtest` wiring
   (SPEC.md §6 explicitly defers this until the classifier passes its own
   metrics) — everything above is classifier-only scoring against ground
   truth, not a fund/CAGR backtest.
